If you are looking for a game that is simple but challenging, colorful but not childish, and fun but not frustrating, you might want to check out Neon Space. Neon Space is a game where you control a little space ship and navigate through various obstacles, puzzles, and checkpoints in a neon-lit environment. The game has 50 levels, each with its own unique mechanics and challenges. You can also use two abilities to help you along the way: slow and blink. Slow lets you slow down everything except your ship, and blink lets you jump a short distance. You can use these abilities to dodge, solve, or even cheat your way through the levels.

Neon Space is available on Steam for $10.99[^4^], but you can also download it for free using a hack. The hack allows you to bypass the Steam verification and play the game without paying anything. However, this hack is illegal and risky, as it may expose your computer to viruses or malware. You may also face legal consequences if you are caught using the hack. Therefore, we do not recommend using the hack and advise you to support the developer by buying the game legally.
 
If you enjoy Neon Space, you might also like its sequel, Neon Space 2[^5^], which has improved graphics and more levels. You can also try other similar games like Neon Invaders[^6^], a retro-style arcade shooter where you blast aliens with your neon spaceship.

Neon Space is a game that will keep you entertained for hours with its addictive gameplay and stunning visuals. Whether you buy it or download it for free, you will have a blast playing this game.

Here are some tips and tricks to help you master Neon Space:
 
- Use your abilities wisely. You have a limited amount of energy for your slow and blink abilities, so don't waste them on easy parts. Save them for when you really need them, such as when you face multiple obstacles or tricky puzzles.
- Don't be afraid to fail. Neon Space is a game that requires trial and error, so you will likely die a lot before you figure out the best way to complete a level. Don't get discouraged by your failures, but learn from them and try again.
- Go for the gold. Each level has a medal system based on your score, which depends on how fast you finish the level and how many times you die. Try to beat your previous score and aim for the gold medal. This will not only give you a sense of achievement, but also improve your skills and reflexes.
- Explore the neon world. Neon Space has a beautiful and colorful aesthetic that creates a contrast between the dark space and the bright neon lights. Take some time to admire the scenery and enjoy the music as you play. You might also discover some hidden secrets or easter eggs along the way.

Neon Space is a game that will challenge your mind and reflexes, but also reward you with a satisfying and fun experience. Download it today and see for yourself why it is one of the most popular games on Steam.
